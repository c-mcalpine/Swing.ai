# Styles

This folder contains CSS files extracted from the HTML designs.

## Structure

- `index.css` - Global styles and resets
- `App.css` - Main app container styles
- `screens/` - (to be created) CSS for individual screens
- `components/` - (to be created) CSS for reusable components
- `common.css` - (to be created) Shared utility classes and variables

## CSS Organization

When converting HTML designs:
1. Extract inline styles to CSS files
2. Group common styles into utility classes
3. Use CSS modules or scoped styles for component-specific styles
4. Consider using CSS variables for colors, spacing, etc.
