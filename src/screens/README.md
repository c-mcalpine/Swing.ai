# Screens

This folder contains one file per screen/page in the application.

Each screen corresponds to an HTML file in the `design/` folder:

- `HomeScreen.jsx` → `design/home.html`
- `OnboardingScreen.jsx` → `design/onboarding.html`
- `InitialSwingSetupScreen.jsx` → `design/initial_swing_setup.html`
- `SwingRecordingScreen.jsx` → `design/swing_recording.html`
- `SwingAnalysisScreen.jsx` → `design/swing_analysis.html`
- `PersonalizedPlanOverviewScreen.jsx` → `design/personalized_plan_overview.html`
- `DailyLessonContentScreen.jsx` → `design/daily_lesson_content.html`
- `DrillDetailsScreen.jsx` → `design/drill_details.html`
- `QuickDrillsSelectionScreen.jsx` → `design/quick_drills_selection.html`
- `SmartReviewScreen.jsx` → `design/smart_review.html`
- `ChallengeLeaderboardScreen.jsx` → `design/challenge_leaderboard.html`
- `ProfileScreen.jsx` → `design/profile.html`

## Naming Convention

- Use PascalCase for screen component names
- Add "Screen" suffix to distinguish from regular components
- Export default from each screen file
